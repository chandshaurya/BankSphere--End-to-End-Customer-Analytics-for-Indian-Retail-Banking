## 🗂 Data Generation (Python + Faker)

The datasets used in **BankSphere** are **synthetic** and were generated using the **[Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/)** Python library to simulate realistic banking data for Indian retail banking scenarios.

### 📌 Process:
1. **Customer Profiles** – Created using Faker’s `name`, `address`, `state`, `occupation`, and `date_of_birth` generators, with additional custom logic for:
   - **Income ranges** aligned with Indian demographics
   - **Account types** (Savings, Current, Salary)
   - **Customer segments** (Platinum, Gold, Regular)

2. **Loan Data** – Generated by assigning:
   - Loan types (Home, Personal, Education, Business)
   - Randomized loan amounts within realistic ranges
   - Interest rates based on loan type
   - Tenure in years
   - Loan disbursement dates tied to customer onboarding year
   - Loan status (`Active`, `Closed`, `Defaulted`)

3. **Transactions** – Simulated transactional activity per customer with:
   - Transaction dates over a 5-year period
   - Categories such as `Groceries`, `Travel`, `Insurance`, `Investments`
   - Debit and credit transactions with realistic frequency

4. **Profitability** – Derived by:
   - Assigning net profit margin per transaction
   - Calculating **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using total transactions and margins
