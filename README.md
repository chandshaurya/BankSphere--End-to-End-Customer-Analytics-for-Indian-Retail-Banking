## üóÇ Data Generation (Python + Faker)

The datasets used in **BankSphere** are **synthetic** and were generated using the **[Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/)** Python library to simulate realistic banking data for Indian retail banking scenarios.

### üìå Process:
1. **Customer Profiles** ‚Äì Created using Faker‚Äôs `name`, `address`, `state`, `occupation`, and `date_of_birth` generators, with additional custom logic for:
   - **Income ranges** aligned with Indian demographics
   - **Account types** (Savings, Current, Salary)
   - **Customer segments** (Platinum, Gold, Regular)

2. **Loan Data** ‚Äì Generated by assigning:
   - Loan types (Home, Personal, Education, Business)
   - Randomized loan amounts within realistic ranges
   - Interest rates based on loan type
   - Tenure in years
   - Loan disbursement dates tied to customer onboarding year
   - Loan status (`Active`, `Closed`, `Defaulted`)

3. **Transactions** ‚Äì Simulated transactional activity per customer with:
   - Transaction dates over a 5-year period
   - Categories such as `Groceries`, `Travel`, `Insurance`, `Investments`
   - Debit and credit transactions with realistic frequency

4. **Profitability** ‚Äì Derived by:
   - Assigning net profit margin per transaction
   - Calculating **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using total transactions and margins

###  Code Snippet:
```python
from faker import Faker
import pandas as pd
import random

faker = Faker('en_IN')

customers = []
for _ in range(1000):
    customers.append({
        "CustomerID": faker.uuid4(),
        "Name": faker.name(),
        "Age": random.randint(21, 70),
        "Gender": random.choice(["Male", "Female"]),
        "City": faker.city(),
        "State": faker.state(),
        "Occupation": random.choice(["Salaried", "Business", "Professional", "Student"]),
        "Income": random.randint(200000, 2000000),
        "CustomerSegment": random.choice(["Platinum", "Gold", "Regular"]),
        "AccountType": random.choice(["Savings", "Current", "Salary"]),
        "AccountOpenYear": random.randint(2010, 2025)
    })

df_customers = pd.DataFrame(customers)
df_customers.to_csv("customers.csv", index=False)

\```
